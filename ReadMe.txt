Software Tool : Visual C++

Steps:

1) Compile both the Main file and Rtree ( Both linked in the code)
2) Create the Folders CA, TG, Syn in the Visual C++ project
   1) Create a Notepad file with CA data sets
   2) Create a notepad file with TG data sets
   3) Create a Notepad file with SYN data sets
3) Categorize the uniform and Gaussian 
4) Run the Performance vs Alpha with all data sets
5) Run the performance vs Vmin, Vmax
6) Output will be genereated on the screen
7) Repeat the process to all other remaining parameters
NOTE: Compare the median for the last performance and Current performance
8) Performance vs Nodes
   1) In the SYN folder create different data set file such as 10k, 20k,30k,50k,100k,1M
      Ex: Create a notepad file with 10k syn data sets
9) Before Running the performance vs Nodes, Check the syn data sets are connected some times there might be missing nodes or edges  
   You still get the values but it may vary.
10) If the Performance vs V[G] doesn't run. Please Remove the cache memory in the Software
11) If the results are varying then re run one after another.
